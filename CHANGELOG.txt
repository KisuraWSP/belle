- Doing some simple fixes
- Rewriting some of the functions so that the codebase doesnt become unnecessarily long and easier to maintain
- Got the Go Modules to work for the project structure
- Project Structure is finalized will need to update the source code from now on
- Currently havent implemented the main language syntax via the lexer, parser, etc...
